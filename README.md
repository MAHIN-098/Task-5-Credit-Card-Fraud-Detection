# Task-5-Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Steps to Run the Project
1)Upload & Load Data
Upload creditcard.csv using files.upload().
Load the dataset using pd.read_csv().

2️)Data Preprocessing
Handle missing values (if any).
Apply SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance the dataset.
Normalize numerical features for better model performance.

3)Train-Test Split
Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
Use train_test_split() for reproducibility.

5️)Model Training & Evaluation
Train a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
Evaluate performance using Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Accuracy.
Generate a Confusion Matrix for better understanding.

Code Structure
Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and balancing.
Feature Engineering: Creating new transaction-based features.
Training: Implementing ML models for classification.
Evaluation: Generating a confusion matrix and classification report.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Finding the best model parameters.

PS:Could not upload the file because it was too big.
